#Documented Script for Homework 1 in BIOL792 II

# First, I went to my Desktop directory : cd Desktop/
# I created a new directory : mkdir Homework
# I entered into that new directory : cd Homework/
# I created another directory inside that Homework directory : mkdir Practice
# I entered into that directory : cd Practice/
# I initialized that directory : git init
# On github, I created a new repository by clicking on new repository, gave it a name, clicked "Add a README file"
# and then created the repository. I named it HomeworkBIOL792. 
# I clicked on that newly created repository, and copied the url.
