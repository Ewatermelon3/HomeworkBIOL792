#Documented Script for Homework 1 in BIOL792 II

# First, I went to my Desktop directory : cd Desktop/
# I created a new directory : mkdir Homework
# I entered into that new directory : cd Homework/
# I created another directory inside that Homework directory : mkdir Practice
# I entered into that directory : cd Practice/
# I initialized that directory : git init
# On github, I created a new repository by clicking on new repository, gave it a name, clicked "Add a README file"
# and then created the repository. I named it HomeworkBIOL792. 
# I clicked on that newly created repository, and copied the url. 
# Next, I added the url to connect with my github repository : git remote add origin https://github.com/Ewatermelon3/HomeworkBIOL792.git
# I double-checked it with remote -v, and I saw the fetch and push responses, which showed me that it worked.
# Next, I created my homework text and added my homework : touch WilsonHW1.txt
# Then I tried to use the code: git push origin master
# Unfortunately, that did not work. I tried to pull first, using "git pull origin master", but that also didn't work.
# I had Trevor help me by creating a clone of the repository : git clone https://github.com/Ewatermelon3/HomeworkBIOL792.git
# This seemed to work. I repeated the process : git add WilsonHW1.txt,
# git commit -m "commit",
# git push origin master
# Now my homework was in my repository on github! I will follow this same process for this script.
